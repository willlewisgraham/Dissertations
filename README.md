Code repository for the University of Edinburgh Statistics with Data Science MSc Dissertation - Forecasting Earthquakes

We can gain insight into how earthquake aftershocks evolve temporally with the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model. 
This code file evaluates the posterior parameter fits of the ETAS model when training on earthquake sequences with varying characteristics. 
Furthermore, this code also serves as a framework for measuring the consequences of incorrectly estimating parameters.

Supervised by Dr. Finn Lindgren and Dr. Daniel Paulin.
